            To ensure a fair competition for all, all projects must be started
            and completed during the event. Your team is welcome to plan and
            brainstorm ideas beforehand, but any use of pre-existing work will
            result in disqualification.

            The number of members on a team can vary from 1 to 4. However, it is
            also possible to participate in the event as an individual. Teams
            can be formed before or during the event, giving you the flexibility
            to work with others or tackle the challenge on your own.

            For the CSHub LHD hackathon, you won't need to bring any overnight
            essentials as it's a 12-hour event. However, it's important to bring
            all the necessary equipment and tools to work on your project. This
            includes laptops, chargers, and any additional hardware that you may
            require. Food and drinks will be provided.  However, you are encouraged to bring a refillable water bottle.
